    <b> Mushtaq A Siddiqi</b>\n\n
    It is a moment of pride for me to address each and every student who aspires to be a part of the IUST family. The Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST) was established in 2005 with an objective to create a fertile environment for young minds to blossom and develop into well-grounded torch bearers of our future. Since then, the university has been constantly striving not only to provide a thorough and in depth academic education to our students but also instill in them righteous and scrupulous values that will go a long way in sculpting a better present and by extension a reliable future.\n\n
    Our motto is directed towards cultivating such a congenial environment on the campus so that students feel at ease while engaging in the plethora of curricular and co-curricular activities that the varsity has to offer. We will be promoting a culture of healthy dialogue and tolerance with emphasis on skill development in addition to a committed attitude towards learning and studies that is supplemented by our state of the art and avant-garde facilities. Our high quality and passionate faculty endeavors to aid and assist all the students in every possible way as we highly value our student community for they are truly the ambassadors and campaigners of our efforts. Faculty is assisted by most dedicated administrative and supportive staff members without whom the infrastructure required for achieving optimal growth of university would have been impossible.\n\n
    IUST has witnessed gradual but steady growth in all the facets of achieving excellence. We have created modern laboratories, computing facilities, web connectivity, library facilities and better power connections. Insha Allah, with the completion and handing over of Lecture theatre block soon, smart classrooms will be available for the upcoming session of 2016. This coupled with sprawling, serene and green campus will provide a conducive environment for the overall growth of our student community for their transformation as educated youth and not literate youth. Our students are our assets in terms of societal commitments and we want to give our best in order to fulfill their dreams. We expect them to be disciplined and open for learning and become leaders in their respective specialties so as to make their alma matter, family and society proud of their achievements. It is important for all stakeholders like students, teachers, and other staff members of IUST to remain focused on their objectives of achieving excellence on the campus as well as in the society. It will give strength and motivation for next group of students to work hard for a greater cause in life. From our side, our primary focus will continue to make this institution a seat of world-class academic learning and research which will ultimately facilitate societal change through inculcating a scientific temper in our community.\n
    I hope the students will benefit greatly by being a part of this university and in turn our present family also benefits from your moral and ethical values, intellect, prudence and wisdom. Wishing you all strength and success for your future.
    Looking forward to seeing you on the campus of IUST soon.</string>

    <string name="CareerDetails"><b>Career Counseling and Placement Cell</b>\n\n
        The holistic development of the students at Islamic University of Science and Technology leads graduates
        of our university stand apart and motto of career counseling and placement cell is to facilitate placement
        and assure achieving a challenging career through career development programs, sharing the hands-on experience
        gained from orientation on entrepreneurship and innovations at company internships. All aspects of the cell focus
        on helping students to reach their dream job. \n
        MBA students got placed with world's best corporates. Some of the leading recruiters are Practo, Think and Learn,
        Colgate Pamolive, Bajaj Electrical, Redington, MRF, Bridgestone, Wipro CCLG, Canara Bank, Madura, Axis Bank,
        ICICI Securities, RBS, WNS, Ocwen Financial Services etc \n\n\n

        <b>Structure of Career Counseling and Placement Cell</b>\n\n

        We function in two domains; Placements and Trainings\n\n

        Placements\n
        This division facilitates placements by actively reaching out to the Corporate World. We try to achieve this objective
            by having a targeted approach towards the three major stakeholders in the placement process i.e. the Students,
            the Companies and the University.\n\n
        Trainings\n
        This division focuses on building an interface between academia and industrial training. Interface facilitates the
        process of curriculum development as per professional needs of the industry by making it more dynamic and job oriented.
        This is made possible by facilitating training of students at different corporate and public sectors. Also continuous
        interaction with the industry by way Guest Lectures and Workshops etc is enabled for better orientation of students at
        industry level. The constantly changing paradigms, in response to growing complexity of the business environment, today,
        have necessitated that universities and industry, which for long have been operating in separate domains should come
        closer to each other for creating synergies. Failure to recognize each other’s role can potentially give rise to mismatch
        between demand and supply of quality manpower which in turn can cause disruption in the job market. In the present times
        of knowledge economy, a productive interface between academia and industry is a critical requirement. \n\n\n\n
